# Open Source LabVIEW Actions

[![Traceability](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD.github.io/badge-summary.json)](https://LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD.github.io/summary.md)

Open Source LabVIEW Actions is a collection of GitHub Actions and PowerShell scripts that streamline LabVIEW CI/CD workflows. Each task is exposed as its own action backed by a unified dispatcher. Refer to the [documentation](docs/index.md) for setup guidance, detailed examples, and the complete action reference.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+ (run `npm install` after cloning to fetch tsx and other dependencies)
- PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`)
- NI LabVIEW with command-line interface support (g-cli) for LabVIEW-based actions
- Supported platforms: Windows for LabVIEW tasks; PowerShell-only scripts also run on macOS and Linux

See [Environment Setup](docs/environment-setup.md) for installation steps and commands to verify each dependency.

## GitHub Action usage

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  uses: LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/open-source/run-unit-tests@v1
  with:
    minimum_supported_lv_version: '2021'
    supported_bitness: '64'
```

Each adapter has its own wrapper. Replace `run-unit-tests` with any action name listed in the [action reference](docs/index.md#action-reference). The wrappers translate the typed inputs above into the dispatcher.

Common optional inputs available on all wrappers:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `gcli_path` | Path to the g-cli executable when it is not on `PATH`. |
| `working_directory` | Directory where the action runs. |
| `log_level` | Verbosity level (`ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`). |
| `dry_run` | Simulate the action without side effects. |

### Examples

Run tests from a subfolder:

```yaml
- uses: LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/open-source/run-unit-tests@v1
  with:
    minimum_supported_lv_version: '2021'
    supported_bitness: '64'
    working_directory: src
```

Enable debug logging and perform a dry run:

```yaml
- uses: LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/open-source/run-unit-tests@v1
  with:
    minimum_supported_lv_version: '2021'
    supported_bitness: '64'
    log_level: DEBUG
    dry_run: true
  ```

For a full workflow example that chains multiple actions to build the LabVIEW Icon Editor, see [docs/quickstart.md#build-icon-editor](docs/quickstart.md#build-icon-editor).

### Automatic VIPM dependency merges

The reusable dependency-update workflow opens a PR containing only the configured
manifest and lock files in the caller repository. These default to `vipm.toml`
and `vipm.lock`. The caller must pass `base_branch`, as shown below for its
default branch. Auto-merge is opt-in.

```yaml
name: Update VIPM dependencies
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  update:
    uses: ni/open-source/.github/workflows/reusable-vipm-update.yml@actions
    with:
      working_directory: scripts/apply-vipc
      labview_version: '2021'
      labview_bitness: '64'
      base_branch: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
      manifest_filename: vipm.toml
      lock_filename: vipm.lock
      include_dev_dependencies: true
      auto_merge: true
```

Use `@actions` for this reusable workflow and the `ni/open-source` actions it
calls. Set the directory, LabVIEW target, and filenames for your repository.
Both the update commit and the squash merge commit use the fixed message
`chore(deps): update VIPM package dependencies`.

The caller must enable **Allow auto-merge** and **Allow squash merging** in its
repository settings. Protect the target branch with required checks and any
required approvals: without these gates, GitHub may merge immediately. The
workflow does not bypass branch protection and fails if GitHub rejects the
auto-merge request.

PR creation and auto-merge use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, subject to repository
permissions. No additional GitHub token secret is needed.
Current GitHub behavior allows PR workflows triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` for
opened, synchronize, and reopened events, but requires a user with write access
to approve those runs. Push workflows are not triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
See [GitHub's workflow-triggering reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow).
Pass the optional VIPM activation secrets separately if your setup needs them.

Repeated runs update the same open dependency PR. A new auto-merge request is
made only when the workflow creates a PR, not when it updates an existing PR or
makes no changes. Existing auto-merge settings are not disabled by this workflow;
an already enabled PR may still merge after updates satisfy its branch rules.
Setting `auto_merge: false` does not revoke an earlier auto-merge request.

The workflow tests assert configuration strings and dry-run dispatcher behavior;
they do not exercise GitHub PR creation, updates, or merging end to end.

## CLI/dispatcher usage

If you prefer or need to run tasks directly, serialize arguments as JSON and call the dispatcher script [actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1](actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1) yourself:

```powershell
$json = @'
{
  "MinimumSupportedLVVersion": "2021",
  "SupportedBitness": "64"
}
'@
pwsh ./actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1 -ActionName run-unit-tests -ArgsJson $json
```
Alternatively, load arguments from a JSON file:

```powershell
pwsh ./actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1 -ActionName run-unit-tests -ArgsFile ./config/run-tests.json
```

By default the dispatcher ignores unknown parameters and emits a warning. Add `-FailOnUnknown` to treat unexpected parameters as errors:

```powershell
pwsh ./actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1 -ActionName run-unit-tests -ArgsJson $json -FailOnUnknown
```

### Discovering actions

List all available actions:

```powershell
pwsh actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1 -ListActions
```

Get details about a specific action:

```powershell
pwsh actions/Invoke-OSAction.ps1 -Describe run-unit-tests
```

## Runner Types

Workflows distinguish between standard GitHub-hosted images and integration runners with preinstalled tooling. See [docs/runner-types.md](docs/runner-types.md) for a detailed comparison.

## Testing

Run the JavaScript tests and generate traceability artifacts with:

```bash
npm install
npm run test:ci
npm run derive:registry
RUNNER_OS=Linux TEST_RESULTS_GLOBS='test-results/*junit*.xml' npm run generate:summary
npm run check:traceability
```

When running locally, set `RUNNER_OS` (for example, `RUNNER_OS=Linux`) before invoking `npm run generate:summary`.

`npm run test:ci` writes JUnit files to `test-results/`. [scripts/generate-ci-summary.ts](scripts/generate-ci-summary.ts) parses these results to build requirement traceability files in OS‑specific subdirectories (e.g., `artifacts/windows`, `artifacts/linux`) based on the `RUNNER_OS` environment variable. Commit `test-results/*` and `artifacts/linux/*` along with your source changes. The summary script searches `artifacts/` by default; set `TEST_RESULTS_GLOBS` if your reports are elsewhere.

Pester tests cover the dispatcher and helper modules. See [docs/testing-pester.md](docs/testing-pester.md) for guidelines on using the canonical argument helper and adding new tests. The GitHub runner installs Pester automatically; install it locally only if you plan to run the tests yourself:

```powershell
Install-Module Pester -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```

```powershell
$cfg = New-PesterConfiguration
$cfg.Run.Path = './tests/pester'
$cfg.TestResult.Enabled = $false
Invoke-Pester -Configuration $cfg
```

XML test result output is intentionally disabled.

## Test and Release Mode

Committing build artifacts together with a `release.json` file enables the
release pipeline. The `release.json` file supplies the JSON payload describing
the release:

```json
{"major":1,"minor":0,"patch":2,"title":"Release title"}
```

Ensure the build artifacts are present (for example under `artifacts/`) and
checked in alongside `release.json`. The `ci.yml` workflow runs first and, on
success, hands off to `release.yml` to publish the release. See
[Test and Release Mode](AGENTS.md#test-and-release-mode) for more details.

## Requirement Traceability

Each requirement is tracked as an issue or entry in
[`requirements.json`](requirements.json). Every code change must reference the
requirement it addresses, and each requirement must have at least one automated
test. The CI pipeline checks these links and reports missing associations. For a
full mapping of requirements to tests, see
[docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines and [docs/contributing-docs.md](docs/contributing-docs.md) for documentation rules.

To preview docs locally:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

## Troubleshooting

If npm prints `npm warn Unknown env config "http-proxy"`, remove the
`npm_config_http_proxy` environment variable or replace it with
`npm_config_proxy`/`npm_config_https_proxy`.

Node.js 24+ removes legacy constants like `fs.R_OK`. Scripts and patches in
this repository rely on `fs.constants.R_OK` to remain compatible with newer
Node releases.
