# Guide for Contributors: Earning LabVIEW Certification Points via Open-Source

This document explains **how contributors** to NI’s open-source LabVIEW projects can earn points toward **LabVIEW certification**. It covers linking your GitHub handle to your NI.com account, understanding T‑Shirt sizes and priorities, viewing your total scores on a public scoreboard, and finally applying those points for recertification.

## Introduction
When you contribute to NI’s open-source LabVIEW repositories, each merged Pull Request (PR) gives you a **score** based on:

1. **T-Shirt Size** (1, 2, 5, 10, 15) – The complexity or scope of the change.  
2. **Priority** (P2 = +0, P1 = +5, P0 = +15) – How critical/urgent the issue was.

This score doubles as:
- A **badge of honor** among the LabVIEW community (bigger changes → bigger recognition).
- **Certification points** you can apply to maintain/renew your LabVIEW certifications (CLD, CLA, etc.).

**Important:** You must link your GitHub handle to your NI.com account **once** to actually apply these points to your certification.

## Step 1: Understand T-Shirt Size & Priority
Each open issue in the repository is labeled with:

- **T-Shirt Size**:  
  - `X-Small (1)`, `Small (2)`, `Medium (5)`, `Large (10)`, or `X-Large (15)`
- **Priority**:  
  - `P2 (+0)`, `P1 (+5)`, or `P0 (+15)`

**Example:**  
- A “Large” (10) + “P1” (+5) issue yields **15 points**.  
- An “X‑Large” (15) + “P0” (+15) yields the maximum **30 points**.

---

## Step 2: Link Your GitHub Handle
To use these scores for certification, you must **link** your GitHub handle with your NI.com account:

1. **One-Time Setup** – The program owner provides a tool or workflow (e.g., OAuth or a token post) where you prove ownership of your GitHub handle.  
2. **Outcome** – After linking, any merges under that handle count toward your **certification** points.  
3. **If Not Linked** – You still accrue a public *score*, but you **can’t** spend it on certification until the link is done (see [Retroactive Linking](#retroactive-linking)).

## Step 3: Contribute & Merge Pull Requests

### Bucket 1 vs. Bucket 2 & 3
- **Bucket 1** (shipping LabVIEW IP):
  - Requires an **automated legal paperwork** check (similar to a CLA).  
  - If you haven’t completed it, your PR is blocked by branch protection.  
- **Bucket 2 & 3** (non-shipping or unsupported IP):
  - No special legal paperwork needed.  
  - Just ensure your GitHub handle is linked if you want certification points.

### Merging a PR
1. Pick an issue labeled “Open for Contribution” with a known T-Shirt size + priority.  
2. Implement your changes, open the PR.  
3. The repository’s branch protection and maintainers handle approvals.  
4. Once merged, the scoreboard (see below) updates with your new total.

---

## Step 4: Check the Scoreboards
There are **two** scoreboard types:

1. **Local Repo Scoreboard** (`SCOREBOARD.md` in that repo)  
   - Lists each contributor’s handle and their earned points for **that specific** repository.  

2. **Global Aggregator**  
   - Combines all NI open-source repos tagged `ni-open-source` to show your **overall** total across multiple projects.

### Real-Time Updates
As soon as your PR merges, these pages automatically refresh. You don’t need to do anything.

### Community “Badge of Honor”
- Other community members can see that a certain user took on high-complexity tasks (e.g. `X-Large + P0`) in a specific repo, signifying advanced expertise.

## Step 5: Use Your Points for Recertification
If you want to apply your **score** toward renewing your LabVIEW certification:

1. **View Your Total**  
   - Look at the aggregator scoreboard to see your overall sum.  
2. **Submit a Recertification Form**  
   - In NI’s recertification request form, specify how many points you want to use from your scoreboard total.  
3. **Certification Team Approval**  
   - They verify the scoreboard total to ensure you have enough.  
   - They confirm your GitHub handle is linked to your NI account.  
   - Once satisfied, they allocate the requested points in your certification record.

**No Single-Use Mechanic**  
- The scoreboard tracks your cumulative “earned” total. It doesn’t decrease when you spend points.  
- Certification sees that total as your “pool” to draw from.

---

## Retroactive Linking
**Did you merge code before linking your handle?**  
- Your scoreboard still shows your GitHub handle’s points.  
- Once you do the linking step, the system updates to reflect those merges under your NI.com identity.  
- Next time you look at the scoreboard (or request points), it shows your full total.  
- No time limit: you can link at any point and get credit for older merges.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linking is Crucial**  
   - Even if you have 100 points on the scoreboard, you **cannot** apply them to recertification unless your handle is linked to your NI account.

2. **Bucket Differences**  
   - **Bucket 1** requires a legal paperwork check. Branch protection blocks merges if you skip it.  
   - **Buckets 2 & 3** just require linking for points usage.

3. **Badge + Points**  
   - T-Shirt Size + Priority system is a public recognition of your contributions.  
   - The same “score” also doubles as recertification points with NI.

4. **Scoreboards for Transparency**  
   - Each repo has a scoreboard showing how many points you earned *there*.  
   - A global aggregator sums your entire open-source footprint across multiple repos.

5. **Recertification Requests**  
   - You choose how many points to apply from your scoreboard total.  
   - If you request more points than you have, Certification will partially deny.  
   - Points are otherwise straightforward to claim.
