# Open-Source LabVIEW Contributions: Hand-Off to Certification

This document explains how the **Open-Source LabVIEW Program** hands off contributor scoring (T-Shirt Size + Priority) to the **Certification Team**, ensuring participants can claim these points toward recertification.

## 1. Introduction & Context

Open-source contributors to NI’s LabVIEW projects earn a **score** (points) when their Pull Requests (PRs) are merged. This score is determined by:

- **T-Shirt Size (Complexity)**: `1, 2, 5, 10, or 15`  
- **Priority (Impact)**: `P2 = +0`, `P1 = +5`, `P0 = +15`

These tallies appear on a **per-repository scoreboard** (a Markdown file) and also in a **global aggregator** for all `ni-open-source` repositories.

From **Certification’s** perspective, these tallies act as **potential recertification points**. Once a participant chooses to use some or all of their points, the Certification Team validates and applies them to their credential.

## 2. How the Hand-Off Works

1. **Automation Emails**  
   - Each time a contributor merges a PR (with a linked NI.com account), an **automated email** is sent to Certification.  
   - This email states the user’s **updated total** across NI open-source repos.

2. **Scoreboards**  
   - **Local Scoreboard:** Each repo has a Markdown page listing every contributor’s points for that specific project.  
   - **Global Aggregator:** A separate page compiles totals across all `ni-open-source` repositories.  
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Both are updated automatically upon each merge.

3. **Certification’s Check**  
   - The Certification Team can **use the emailed totals** or **audit** them by opening the public scoreboard pages.

## 3. Retroactive Linking

- If a contributor didn’t link their GitHub handle at merge time, the scoreboard still shows points under their handle.  
- Once they **link** that handle to an NI.com account, the open-source automation:
  1. Retroactively associates all prior merges with their identity.
  2. Updates the scoreboard to reflect their *real name* or known identity (if desired).
  3. Sends a new email with the **recalculated total** to Certification.

**Implication:** The Certification Team might see a sudden jump in the contributor’s total if they link after multiple merges.

## 4. Steps for the Certification Team

Below is a step-by-step summary for **Certification**:

1. **Receive the Automated Email**  
   - Each merge triggers a message stating: “Contributor X has a new total of Y points.”

2. **Archive or Track**  
   - You can store these emails in an inbox or reference system.  
   - **No immediate action** is necessary unless the user requests points for recertification.

3. **When a Participant Requests Points**  
   1. **Check** that participant’s total (from the most recent email or by visiting the relevant scoreboard).  
   2. **Verify** they have at least as many points as they want to apply.  
   3. **Approve** those points if valid and record them in your certification system.

4. **Handling Overclaims**  
   - If the participant requests more than the scoreboard total, you can **deny or partially fulfill**.  
   - If something seems off, reference the scoreboard or contact the Program Owner.

5. **No Merge-Level Approval Required**  
   - The open-source pipeline handles T-Shirt sizing, branch protection, and legal paperwork (for shipping IP).  
   - Your only role is **final point allocation** based on the scoreboard.

## 5. T-Shirt Sizing as a Badge of Honor

- **Community Recognition**:  
  Contributors show off their T-Shirt Size + Priority achievements on each repo’s scoreboard, indicating the difficulty/impact of their work (e.g., an X Large + P0 is a major feat).

- **Certification Points**:  
  The same score also translates into recertification points.  
  - **Example**: X Large (15) + P0 (15) = 30 points total, both for personal recognition and for NI recertification.

## 6. Key Considerations & Constraints

1. **Real-Time Updates**  
   - The scoreboard (local and global) refreshes automatically once a PR merges.  
   - The automation email to Certification also reflects the new total immediately.

2. **Scoreboard Is Cumulative**  
   - It does *not* subtract points when the user redeems them for recertification.  
   - Think of it as **earned** points, not a “current balance” that goes down.

3. **Global vs. Repo-Specific**  
   - Each repo has its own scoreboard.  
   - A separate **global** aggregator shows the sum across all `ni-open-source` repos for each contributor.  
   - Certification can check either, but the aggregator is usually simpler for verifying total points.

4. **No T-Shirt Size Disputes**  
   - If a participant questions the assigned T-Shirt Size/Priority, direct them to the **Program Owner**.  
   - Certification does not intervene in sizing decisions.

## 7. Closing Summary

- **Hand-Off**: The open-source program **emails** you each contributor’s updated total after every merged PR.  
- **Validation**: You can **audit** the scoreboard if needed (each repo’s Markdown file or the global aggregator).  
- **Points Request**: When participants want to recertify, they request some or all of those points.  
- **Retroactive**: Linking can happen any time; the scoreboard and emails adapt accordingly.

**Outcome**: A simple, automated pipeline that **minimizes Certification’s workload** while **maximizing transparency** for contributors and NI staff alike.
